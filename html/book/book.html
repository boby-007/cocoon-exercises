       <em><strong>Moby Dick </strong></em> is an epic piece of literature on a par with Homer’s 
        Iliad and Shakespeare’s King Lear and the Bible’s Job. 
        It is densely rich in language and structure, in character and story</p>
    <p>Its account of a man against a whale is a story that had never been told before with such grandeur. 
        Yet, it parallels other efforts by master storytellers down the centuries to portray humans confronting 
        the unanswerable questions of existence.Like Job grappling with the question of why bad things happen 
        to good people — indeed, why suffering is in the world.Like Lear raging against the deterioration of 
        the body, the betrayal of others and, even more, his own betrayals of himself.
        Achilles, the unconquerable, fights and dies because of a fatal flaw. Oedipus 
        unknowingly kills his father and has sex with his mother because of the blindness 
        that every human being is born with, the inability to know everything, to understand
        the consequences of actions. To fully understand Moby Dick would require months, probably years.  And I read it just once.</p>
